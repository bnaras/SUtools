Description: Tools for including FORTRAN and MORTRAN code in R
             packages. A number of important R packages from Stanford
             developers make use of MORTRAN code and it is a chore to
             ensure that the generated FORTRAN is palatable to
             CRAN. It turns out that many of the violations can be
             addressed by automatically processing the MORTRAN and
             generated FORTRAN code using facilities in this
             package, thereby relieving one of the chore.
